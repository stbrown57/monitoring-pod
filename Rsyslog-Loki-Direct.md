**Yes**, Rsyslog can forward logs directly to a Grafana Alloy server without needing to save the logs to a file for scraping.

Grafana Alloy includes a component specifically designed to receive logs using the Syslog protocol.

## Direct Forwarding via Syslog

You can configure a direct log pipeline using the following steps:

### 1\. Configure Grafana Alloy

Grafana Alloy uses the **`loki.source.syslog`** component to listen for incoming Syslog messages over a network port (typically TCP or UDP).

In your Alloy configuration file (e.g., `config.alloy`), you would define a listener like this:

```alloy
loki.source.syslog "rsyslog_input" {
  listener {
    address = "0.0.0.0:1514"  // Listen on all interfaces on port 1514
    protocol = "tcp"          // Use TCP for reliable log delivery
    labels = {
      component = "rsyslog_forwarder",
      protocol  = "tcp"
    }
  }
  forward_to = [loki.write.loki_endpoint.receiver] // Forward to a loki.write component
}

loki.write "loki_endpoint" {
  endpoint {
    url = "http://<Loki_Server_Address>:3100/loki/api/v1/push"
  }
}
```

### 2\. Configure Rsyslog

On the system running Rsyslog, you configure it to use the **`omfwd`** output module to forward all (or selected) logs to the Alloy server's listening port.

In your Rsyslog configuration file (e.g., in `/etc/rsyslog.d/`), you would add a rule like this:

```rsyslog
*.* action(
    type="omfwd"
    Target="<Alloy_Server_IP_or_Hostname>"
    Port="1514"
    Protocol="tcp"
    Template="RSYSLOG_SyslogProtocol23Format" // Recommended to use a modern format
)
```

**Key Point:** Using a modern format like `RSYSLOG_SyslogProtocol23Format` (RFC 5424) is generally recommended for better metadata and timestamp preservation.

## Alternative: File Scraping

While direct Syslog forwarding is the most efficient and recommended approach for Rsyslog, you could technically still use the **file scraping method**:

  * **Rsyslog** saves logs to a specific file (e.g., `/var/log/custom_app.log`).
  * **Grafana Alloy** uses the **`loki.source.file`** component to tail and scrape the content of that file, then processes and forwards the lines to Loki.

This method adds a layer of complexity and an extra disk I/O step compared to direct network forwarding. **Direct Syslog forwarding is the preferred method** for integrating a logging daemon like Rsyslog with a Syslog-capable collector like Grafana Alloy.
